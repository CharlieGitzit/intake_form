# Immigration Intake Experience

Welcome! This project provides a conversational intake experience designed to mirror the structure of official U.S. immigration forms. It helps individuals organize and share accurate information in a calm, respectful, and guided way — like having a friendly, guided form that talks with you, not just a bunch of fields to fill.

This tool does not provide legal advice. Its purpose is to prepare individuals for a more productive conversation with a licensed immigration professional by ensuring key intake information is structured and ready in advance. The goal is to reduce stress, improve clarity, and help people move forward with confidence when seeking professional guidance for their immigration process.
